# MVCCalendarDemo
Calendar Demo

To anyone that happens to read this.  Thanks for viewing my GitHub account.  
This was a small part of a larger project that I worked on with a Portland Based Consulting Firm.
What you see has gone through many steps and trial versions.
In it's current developmental phase it is an example of A Full Calendar customized within the MVC Code First .NET Frameworks
I am hoping to add an interactive version to my webpage so that viewers can play with its features and capabilities as demonstration of how you can merge all of the concepts applied.
This calendar has complete CRUD functionality with the ability to save to the test database all events created or removed.



For the last C# project it was a new construction company project called ManagementPortal.sin Stored locally: C:\Users\Student\Documents\C#_LiveProject

For the final back-end focused sprint I worked on a single story that was worth several but ended up utilizing back-end and front-end skills to create a fully functioning application that could be added to the main project built with a functional database for requesting and adding time off requests for employees.

# .NET-MVC-C-Web-Application
Work done with Prosper IT Consulting Dev Ops Team


# Live Project

## Introduction

I took part in a non-paid internship with Prosper IT Consulting working as a software developer as part of a Dev Ops team that worked on building a web application that would perform as a possible intranet for a Portland based construction company.  The project was in an early phase.

This project leveraged the power of .NET frameworks and MVC.  The main programming language used was C# in addition to the front-end languages.

Below is the description of a challenging story I helped work on in an AGILE environment along with code snippets and navigation links.
