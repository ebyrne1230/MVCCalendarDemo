Calendar Demo

To anyone that happens to read this.  Thanks for viewing my GitHub account.  
This was a small part of a larger project that I worked on with a Portland Based Consulting Firm.
What you see has gone through many steps and trial versions.
In it's current developmental phase it is an example of A Full Calendar customized within the MVC Code First .NET Frameworks
I am hoping to add an interactive version to my webpage so that viewers can play with its features and capabilities as demonstration of how you can merge all of the concepts applied.
This calendar has complete CRUD functionality with the ability to save to the test database all events created or removed.



For the last C# project it was a new construction company project called ManagementPortal.sin Stored locally: C:\Users\Student\Documents\C#_LiveProject

For the final back-end focused sprint I worked on a single story that was worth several but ended up utilizing back-end and front-end skills to create a fully functioning application that could be added to the main project built with a functional database for requesting and adding time off requests for employees.
